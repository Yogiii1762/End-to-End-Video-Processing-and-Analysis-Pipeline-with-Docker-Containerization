**Project Title: Automated Video Analysis and Object Detection System Using Docker and Python**

- Developed a robust video analysis pipeline to perform automated object detection on video frames using Python and YOLOv8.
- Engineered a containerized solution using Docker to ensure environment consistency, scalability, and ease of deployment across different platforms.
- Implemented frame extraction from video files, converting each frame into images for subsequent processing.
- Utilized YOLOv8 model for high-precision object detection, analyzing frames and generating bounding boxes with confidence scores.
- Designed and implemented a data storage solution using SQLite, storing detection results for efficient querying and retrieval.
- Developed a visualization component to generate real-time plots of detected objects over time using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Optimized Dockerfile for efficient build times and smaller image size by leveraging multi-stage builds, specific dependency installations, and caching mechanisms.
- Ensured security and best practices by running the application as a non-root user within the Docker container.
- Integrated health check mechanisms to monitor the container's status and ensure high availability and reliability.
- Created comprehensive documentation and a `.dockerignore` file to streamline the development process and reduce build context size.
